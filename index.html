                                King Pudding has a sad backstory. He turned expressionless from the shock 
                                of being abandoned as a kid. Then he turned into a pudding when his
                                current family took him in.

                    <p>
                        King Pudding changed the financial state of my wallet. I developed an  
                        inclination to devour pudding. By extension, Pom Pom Purin became my favorite
                        Sanrio character. And by extention of that, a portion of my wallet has been 
                        allocated towards Pom Pom Purin as well. Puddings are everywhere. On my desk,
                        on my shelves, on my door, in my PC, and on my bed. Not to mention, he is my 
                        phonecase, my phone wallpaper, on my phone widgets, on my phone keyboard, and is 
                        the icon for a selection of apps. Although my obsession is on par with Tamaki, 
                        he is not my favorite character. Instead, my favorite character is King Pudding (and Izumi Mitsuki).
